Workshops and Papers presentations at ICRA 2025

<!--more-->

A delegation from IDRA attended the 41st edition ICRA conference, held in Atlanta (US) in the days 18-23 May 2025.

The first day kickstarted with the workshop “Learning Meets Model-Based Methods for Contact-Rich Manipulation” (https://contact-rich.github.io/), where [Matteo Dalle Vedove](/author/matteo-dallevedove/) gave a poster presentation about his work on motion policy learning on surfaces. The official presentation of the article  [MeshDMP: Motion Planning on Discrete Manifolds using Dynamic Movement Primitives](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15123) was given by Matteo on the first session of Tuesday, where a 5 minute presentation followed a participated poster session. This work presents a novel DMP-based method for learning motion policies on surfaces which relax the requirement of the manifold to be smooth, but only requires a polyhedral mesh.

[Elias Fontanari](/author/elias-fontanari) partecipated as contributor at the poster session of the workshop [Robot safety under uncertainty from “intangible” specifications](https://iscicra25.github.io/), presenting the developed method to enhance safety in Model Predictive Control (MPC) exploiting the employment of parallel computation.
The official presentation of the work, titled 'Parallel-Constraint Model Predictive Control: Exploiting Parallel Computation for Improving Safety' was held on Thursday, during the Collision Avoidance session. It was discussed how this novel method improves safety in non-linear MPC relying on learned safe sets and it was followed by a interactive poster session.

The last day has seen the participation of IDRA members to lots of workshop with multiple oral presentation. [Elena Basei](/author/elena-basei/) participated in the poster session for the workshop [Language and Semantics of Task and Motion Planning](https://dyalab.mines.edu/2025/icra-workshop/). She presented preliminary results of her research on proactive motion planning in human-robot collaboration. In her work, she integrated human motion prediction into a motion planning algorithm for robot manipulators, aiming to enhance both safety and efficiency.
[Elias Fontanari](/author/elias-fontanari) presented the work at the poster session of another workshop entitled [Beyond the Lab: Robust Planning and Control in Real World Scenarios](https://sites.google.com/view/robust-planning-icra2025-ws).
[Matteo Dalle Vedove](/author/matteo-dallevedove/) presented his work in [The Future of Intelligent Manufacturing: From innovation to implementation](https://sites.google.com/view/intelligent-manufacting-icra25/home) in front of an audience of academia researchers and industrial partners.
Finally, [Edoardo Lamon](/author/edoardo-lamon/) presented two works, the first one on the generation of anatomocally accyrate virtual fixtures for chest ultrasound, at the workshop [3rd Robot-Assisted Medical Imaging (RAMI)](https://sites.google.com/view/rami-icra-2025-workshop/home), and the second on LLM-aided knowledge base generation for temporal planning of robotic tasks at the workshop [Language and Semantics of Task and Motion Planning](https://dyalab.mines.edu/2025/icra-workshop/).

Looking forward next ICRA in Vienna, see you there!!
