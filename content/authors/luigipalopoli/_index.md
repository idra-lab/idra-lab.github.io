I am an full Professor at the University of Trento in the Dipartimento di Ingegneria e Scienza dell'Informazione, where I have worked since 2004 covering different research areas. One of my greatest interest is assistive and medical robotics. In this area I have been Coordinator of two large EU research projects: DALI and ACANTO. More recently, I have given my contribution in Robotic Localisation, Human Aware Motion Planning, and Collaborative robotics. The main area of application of my research include manufacturing, digital health and precision agriculture.
