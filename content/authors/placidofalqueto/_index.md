Meet Placido Falqueto, a dedicated researcher in human-robot collaboration! He has worked with various systems, from assistive robots to collaborative manipulators. He was a finalist at the IRIM 3D 2022 conference in Rome for his work on shared control for a robotic walker. Currently, Placido is developing human-aware motion planning for robotic arms using gesture predictions. He programs in C++ and Python, leveraging both traditional tools like GMM and modern ones like ViT to push the boundaries of robotics!
