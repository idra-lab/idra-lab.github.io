I received the M.S. degree in Information Engineering in 2001, and the Ph.D. degree in Automation, Robotics and Bioengineering in 2006, both from the University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy.  I was a Visiting Scientist with the Vision Lab of the University of California at Los Angeles, Los Angeles, US, from 2006 to 2007.  From 2007 to 2008, I was an Associate Researcher with the Interdepartmental Research Center ``E. Piaggio'', University of Pisa.  From 2008 to 2013, I joined as an Associate Researcher the Department of Information Engineering and Computer Science and from 2014 the Department of Industrial Engineering, both at the University of Trento, Trento, Italy, where I am now a Full Professor in the field of Measurement and Robotics.  I authored and co-authored more than 200 scientific papers in peer-reviewed top journals and conference proceedings.  I am currently a Senior Area Editor for the IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement and an Associate Editor for the IET Science, Measurement & Technology Journal and for the IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters. I also served in the technical program committee of numerous conferences in the area of measurements and robotics, and I am a member of TC17 - Measurement in Robotics. I served as an Associate Editor in Chief from 2021 to 2023 and as an Associate Editor from 2019 to 2021 for the IEEE Transactions on  Instrumentation. I am the co-founder of Polytec Intralogistics Srl (aka Dolomiti Robotics - https://dolomitirobotics.it/). I am the PI of the EU project MAGICIAN - iMmersive leArninG for ImperfeCtion detectIon and repAir through human-robot interactioN - and I was the co-founder and the PI of the EIT-Digital international Master on ``Autonomous Systems'' from 2017 to 2023. My research interests include distributed and real-time estimation and control, localisation algorithms, synchrophasor estimation, clock synchronisation algorithms, resource aware control, wheeled mobile robots, service robotics and human-robot interaction and estimation.
