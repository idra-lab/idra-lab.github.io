Francesco is a Ph.D. graduate in Information and Communication Technology from the University of Trento, where he fearlessly tackled mobile robotics with nothing but MATLAB and a piece of paperâ€”no need for the trendy ROS! His research explored observability and constructibility analysis of nonholonomic vehicles, showing that practical solutions can come from straightforward approaches. With a focus on perception-aware motion planning, he proves that sometimes the simplest methods can lead to interesting insights.
