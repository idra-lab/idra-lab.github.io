Giulia d'Addato is a Ph.D. student in Autonomous Systems at the University of Trento. Her research focuses on human-robot interaction, specifically in the area of multi-robot trajectory planning and control for cooperative tasks in dynamic environments. Currently, her work revolves around socially-aware navigation, and one of her recent projects involves the development of a hybrid model that combines nonlinear opinion dynamics and vortex fields to ensure safe and human-friendly robot navigation in complex human-populated environments. In the future, she would like to extend my research into multi-agent systems and explore how robots can influence human opinions during interaction, as well as the transition from mobile robots to more complex manipulators. Stay tuned for updates!
