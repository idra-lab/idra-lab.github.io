I am Associate Professor at the Department of Industrial Engineering of the
University of Trento. Previously, I was Associate Professor (RTD-A) at the Field
Robotics South Tyrol (FiRST), working on autonomous mobile robot navigation 
in the field. From 2018 to 2022 I served as PDRA and Senior Researcher in robot
navigation at the Dynamic Robot System lab of the Oxford Robotics Institute,
University of Oxford, UK. From 2014 to 2018 I was member of the Dynamic Legged
System (DLS) lab at the Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia (IIT) in Genoa, Italy,
where I received my PhD in Bioengineering and Robotics in 2017. 
I have received the B.Eng. and M.Eng. degrees in computer 
engineering from the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia,
Modena, Italy, in 2009 and 2012, respectively. 

My research interests lie in all aspects of mobile robot autonomy in harsh
environments, including but not limited to field robotics,  
mobile robot perception, model predictive
control, autonomous navigation, sensor fusion, and legged robotics.
