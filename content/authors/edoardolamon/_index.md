I am an Assistant Professor (RTD-A) at Università di Trento in the Department of Information Engineering and Computer Science (DISI). From 2021 to 2024 I acted as Post-Doc at the Human-Robot Interfaces and Interaction (HRI²) group at the Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia (IIT), Genoa, Italy. At the University of Trento, I joined the Interdepartmental Robotics Lab (IDRA) where I am the leading researcher of the medical robotics group.  
My research focuses on combining a human-centric approach to robotic operations with artificial intelligence, with the aim of boosting robotics in everyday life, with applications ranging from manufacturing to medical scenarios.
