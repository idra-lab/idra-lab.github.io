Matteo Dalle Vedove is a PhD student working on the transfer of human skills to robotic manipulators.
He is currently focusing on extension of Learning from Demonstration tools to be applied on contact-rich tasks, such as polishing, wiping, or grinding.
To smoothen the development of robotic application, he combines the theory with a strong enthusiasm for programming, with a particular focus on C++ and ROS2. 
Aside research, Matteo plays the trombone in a local marching band!
