Let me introduce you to Davide Nardi, a PhD student at the University of Trento's medical robotics team. During his master's degree, he contributed to a project on human-robot interaction, and then began working on robotized teleoperated lung ultrasound. Currently, he is addressing the challenge of human body modeling to constrain robot interaction with patients and speed up ultrasound examinations. He enjoys programming in C++ and Python within the ROS2 framework and is enthusiastic about contributing to open-source projects.
