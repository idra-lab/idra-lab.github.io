This is a research and innovation project funded by Horizon Europe. Website: [https://magician-project.eu/](https://magician-project.eu/).

- 4-year EU project: October 2023-September 2027
- 11 consortium partners from 7 countries across Europe coordinated by Universit√† di Trento
- 1 Automotive Use Case and extension of Use Cases through 2 Open Calls

## Vision

MAGICIAN will develop robotic solutions to classify and rework defects from semi-finished products autonomously before the finalization of product aesthetics.

These solutions are designed to be **modular**, applicable to **various manufacturing fields**, **reducing physical strain** and **enhancing safety** for human operators.

 

## Challenges

Consumers increasingly expect manufacturing products to be free of defects which sets high standards for the production process. However, associated working processes are physically and cognitively demanding for workers and executed in a potentially hazardous environment.

 

## Solutions

Two modular robotic solutions:
- a sensing robot for defect analysis (SR)
- a cleaning robot for reworking defects (CR) 

Both robots will use AI modules to perform associated operations. Data needed for these AI modules will be gathered by learning from workers operating on semi-finished products.

**Human-centred approach**: MAGICIAN applies a  human-centred design strategy to shape the progress of automation and human-robot collaboration in manufacturing towards an emphasis on trust, empathy, and ethics.

**Use Cases**: MAGICIAN solutions will be tested in an automotive manufacturing use case. Both robots will be coupled with human operators during the testing to ensure trust-based human-robot collaboration.  Additional use cases will be engaged through two Open Calls.
