# Welcome to the Medical Robotics Group

## Overview

The medical robotics research is at the forefront of integrating advanced robotics with medical applications. We focus on two primary areas: **teleoperated robotic ultrasound examinations** and **autonomous robotic palpation for cancer detection**. Our goal is to enhance the precision, safety, and efficiency of medical procedures through cutting-edge robotic technologies.

## Teleoperated Robotic Ultrasound Examinations

Teleoperated robotic ultrasound systems allow medical professionals to perform ultrasound examinations remotely. This technology is particularly beneficial in scenarios where access to specialized medical expertise is limited. Our research aims to:

- Develop intuitive teleoperation interfaces for seamless control.
- Ensure high-fidelity image acquisition and real-time feedback.
- Enhance the safety and reliability of remote ultrasound procedures.

## Autonomous Robotic Palpation for Cancer Detection

Early detection of cancer can significantly improve treatment outcomes. Our robotized palpation system is designed to assist in the early detection of tumors through precise and consistent palpation techniques. Key features of our research include:

- Advanced algorithms for tissue viscoelastic characterization.
- Integration with collaborative robotic arms for safe and effective palpation.
- Development of silicon phantoms to mimic human tissues for testing and validation.

## The Team

Our interdisciplinary team comprises experts in robotics, estimation, and artificial intelligence. We collaborate closely with medical professionals to ensure our solutions meet clinical needs and standards.
