# Welcome to the Medical Robotics Project

## Overview

Our Medical Robotics Project is at the forefront of integrating advanced robotics with medical applications. We focus on two primary areas: **robotic ultrasound with teleoperation** and **robotized palpation for cancer detection**. Our goal is to enhance the precision, safety, and efficiency of medical procedures through cutting-edge robotic technologies.

## Robotic Ultrasound with Teleoperation

Teleoperated robotic ultrasound systems allow medical professionals to perform ultrasound examinations remotely. This technology is particularly beneficial in scenarios where access to specialized medical expertise is limited. Our research aims to:

- Develop intuitive teleoperation interfaces for seamless control.
- Ensure high-fidelity image acquisition and real-time feedback.
- Enhance the safety and reliability of remote ultrasound procedures.

## Robotized Palpation for Cancer Detection

Early detection of cancer can significantly improve treatment outcomes. Our robotized palpation system is designed to assist in the early detection of tumors through precise and consistent palpation techniques. Key features of our research include:

- Advanced algorithms for tissue viscoelastic characterization.
- Integration with collaborative robotic arms for safe and effective palpation.
- Development of silicon phantoms to mimic human tissues for testing and validation.

## Our Team

Our interdisciplinary team comprises experts in robotics, estimation, and artificial intelligence. We collaborate closely with medical professionals to ensure our solutions meet clinical needs and standards.

## Publications and Events

We actively participate in leading conferences and publish our findings in top-tier journals. Recent highlights include:

- Workshop and paper presentation at [IROS 2024 Abu Dhabi](/post/iros2024/).
<!-- - Ongoing research projects and collaborations with renowned institutions. -->
