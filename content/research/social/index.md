## Overview

Work in progress!

## Social Navigation

Social Robot Navigation focuses on developing robots that can navigate safely and naturally around people in shared environments. We aim to create systems that allow robots to move smoothly in crowded spaces, respecting social norms and avoiding people and obstacles. In this way, robots will be able to fit seamlessly into everyday life and improve the way they interact and cooperate with people in real-world scenarios.

## Our Team

Our interdisciplinary team comprises experts in robotics, estimation, and artificial intelligence, planning and scheduling, computer vision, human computer interaction, natural language processing. We collaborate closely with people to ensure our solutions meet acceptance and meets the safety standards.
