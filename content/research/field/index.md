## Overview

 Field robotics deals with the fundamentals and applications of mobile robots operating in unstructured and dynamic environments, where conditions cannot be controlled. Applications include, but are not limited to: **precision agroforestry**, **construction**, **space exploration**, and **industrial inspection**. Our research focuses on the development of novel algorithms for perception, planning and control of mobile robots (tracked, wheeled, legged), parameter modeling and system identification (e.g., slippage in tracked robots on slopes), as well as novel unconventional robot designs (e.g., roped-legged). 



### Prototyping and Development of Climbing Robots

In addition to theoretical research, our group is also involved in the prototyping and development of advanced robotic systems designed for a variety of applications. One of these projects is the creation of a climbing robot, Alpine, developed with the goal of reducing human presence in difficult or hazardous environments.
By implementing advanced optimization systems, the robot is capable of avoiding obstacles and navigating complex environments in a semi-autonomous or fully autonomous manner.
This system enables analysis, maintenance, and inspection operations in high-risk environments such as rock walls,is specifically designed to carry heavy tools, remain stationary without consuming energy, thereby minimizing direct human exposure to extreme conditions.
The development of this prototype required the integration of multiple multidisciplinary skills, including:

- **Mechanical engineering**: design and construction of the climbing robot structure, involving knowledge of pneumatics, applied physics, and 3D modeling.
- **Electronics and mechatronics**: selection and integration of sensors and actuators necessary for the robot’s operation and stability.
- **Computer science and robotics**: development of control and navigation software, including computer vision algorithms for environment recognition, surface classification, and foreign object detection, as well as optimization algorithms for path planning.
- **Supervision and remote control systems**: development of a web application for real-time monitoring and remote operation of the robot, allowing operators to supervise tasks and intervene safely and efficiently.
