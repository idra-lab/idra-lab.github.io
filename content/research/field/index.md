# summary: |-
Field Robotics research deals with the fundamentals and applications of mobile robots operating in unstructured and dynamic environments, where conditions cannot be controlled. Applications include, but are not limited to: precision agroforestry, construction, space exploration, and industrial inspection. Our research focuses on the development of novel algorithms for perception, planning and control of mobile robots (tracked, wheeled, legged), parameter modeling and system identification (e.g., slippage in tracked robots on slopes), as well as novel unconventional robot designs (e.g., roped-legged).
